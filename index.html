            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>In August 2018, I graduated from the <strong>University of Minnesota MERN Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp</strong>. 
                Over the three months of the Bootcamp, I developed a strong interest in Front End Development, and I have been taking further online classes to improve my front end skills.
                I am looking forward to continuing my personal development as a Front End Developer.</p>
            
                <h3>Here are a few of the projects that I worked on at the Bootcamp:</h3> 
        </div>
        <!-- Crystal Collector -->
        <div class="CrystalCollector">
            <img src="img/crystals.jpeg" class="crystal-image" alt="crystals">
        
            <h3><a href="https://alisonfahy.github.io/CrystalCollector/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">Crystal
                    Collector</a></h3>
        
            <p class="crystal-text">This is one of my early homework projects, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.
                Getting this game to work was a big achievement for me in the early weeks of the Bootcamp!
                I am hoping to be able to go back and update the CSS with some of the new skills I have been learning since I
                finished the Bootcamp.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Trivia Game -->
        <div class="TriviaGame">
            <img src="img/ViolinMusic.jpg" class="violin-image" alt="violin">
        
            <h3><a href="https://alisonfahy.github.io/Trivia-Game/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">Trivia Game</a></h3>
        
            <p>I teach people of all ages how to play the violin, and I created this Trivia Game with my younger students in
                mind.
                This game is built with HTML, CSS, and JQuery.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Amet Locus -->
        <div class="AmetLocus">
            <img src="img/AmetLocus.png" class="movie-image" alt="movie">
        
            <h3><a href="https://bc-project1.herokuapp.com/index.html" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary ">Amet Locus
                    (Find a Movie)</a></h3>
        
            <p>This is the first Group Project that I worked on during the Bootcamp.
                Using API's from YouTube, OMDB, and TMS(Gracenote), the user can search for movies playing in the area, select a
                movie, get movie details, and watch the trailer on YouTube.
                I was part of the Front End team for this project.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Whiteboard -->
        <div class="Whiteboard">
            <img src="img/Whiteboard.png" class="whiteboard-image" alt="Whiteboard">
        
            <h3><a href="https://whiteboardstudio.herokuapp.com/ " target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">Whiteboard Studio</a></h3>
        
            <p>This is the second Group Project that I worked on during the Bootcamp.
                The <strong>Whiteboard Studio</strong> app allows users to draw together in real time. Boards can be public or
                private, and private boards can be saved.
                Socket.io, and P5.js were the new technologies used for this app. I was part of the Front End team for this
                project, and assisted as needed with other components.
